## Retrocade Utils

This is a set of utility classes for ActionScript 3.0, which contains the following packages:

 - **net.retrocade.collision** - Geometrical collision, currently supported shapes are Circle, Line, Rectangle and an arbitrary polygon
 - **net.retrocade.constants** - Two constant classes for keyboard keys (similar to Keyboard class) and alphabet
 - **net.retrocade.random** - RNG factory and engines (currently supported two)
 - **net.retrocade.utils** - Utility classes, grouped by class type.

## Disclaimer

These classes and methods have been collected in the past few year sand if by any chance it happens that any of it origins from another people's code I'd be very grateful for information so I can either remove them or credit the authors accordingly.
